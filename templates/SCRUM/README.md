# Git: GitHub and GitLab templates

Here you can find a bunch of templates for various documents.  

Each file may contains this syntax: `${X: Y}` with `X` the indice of this note
to change and `Y` is the topic of the note to put at this place.

For example: `${1: your custom title}` is the first note to change and should be
replaced by the topic (example: _My title_)
